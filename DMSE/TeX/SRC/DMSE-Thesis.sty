% Uncomment *one* of the following lines if you are tired of TeX's
% Computer Modern fonts.

% Preferably, use one of the following "FE-..." font packages. These
% packages include settings for microtype and font size adjustments for
% upright Greek letters.

\usepackage{FE-Heuristica}


% Alternatively, you can load one the following packages. These require
% some manual adjustments -- see below.

% \usepackage{fourier} 
% \usepackage{mathpazo}
% \usepackage{mathptmx}
% \usepackage{heuristica}


% If you are using one of these ("non-FE") packages, you can manually
% perform (a) the size adjustment for upright greek letters and (b)
% fine adjustments of typesetting.

% (a) Size adjustment for upright greek letters: Uncomment the following command. Typset text with upright greek letters next to latin letters, e.g. "a \ualpha a \ualpha a". Then adjust the real-number argument until the size of the greek letters matches that of the latin letters of the font you have chosen.

% \renewcommand{\uGreekMag}{1.065}

% (b) Improve text appearance. The package microtype makes fine
% adjustments to produce text with professional appearance. This
% encompasses fine adjustments to word and character spacing, character
% width, and the protrusion of punctuation (especially hyphens) into the
% margin to give the text the appearance of a perfectly straight edge.

% These are the options for microtype:

% Option activate: activate protrusion and
% expansion. Option final: enable microtype. Use "draft" to disable.

% Options tracking=true, kerning=true, spacing=true: Used to activate
% the respective techniques.

% Option "factor" controls the protrusion amount. The default value of
% factor is 1000. Setting e.g. factor=1200 will add 20\% to the default
% protrusion.

% Options stretch and shrink: Reduce stretchability/shrinkability. The default values are stretch=20, shrink=20.

% Uncomment the following command and adjust the parameters if the
% results are not satisfactory.

%\usepackage[activate={true,nocompatibility},final,tracking=true,kerning=true,spacing=true,factor=1200,stretch=10,shrink=10]{microtype}


% Set gray level of headlines.
