% OPTIONAL PACKAGES
%----------------------------------------------------------------------%
% The following packages may be useful. However, to minimize compilation
% time, you should only activate them when needed.

% Upright Greek letters.
% Normally, you typeset Greek letters in math mode. They will then be typeset in italics, appropriate for variables. However, there are many instances in which Greek letters are not used for variables. For instance, the Greek letters used for indicating thermodynamic phases (e.g. alpha-Sn) or spectral lines (e.g. Cu-K_alpha). The following package provides support for upright Greek letters.
\usepackage{FE-uGreek}

% Subfigures of figures.
%\usepackage{subcaption}

% Landscape environment.
%\usepackage{pdflscape} 

% Tables spanning more than one page.
%\usepackage{longtable}

% PDFPages imports entire PDF pages.
% \usepackage[final]{pdfpages}

% For comment environment.
% \usepackage{verbatim} 

% Wrapfig wraps text around tables and figures.
% \usepackage{wrapfig}

% Tables with cells spanning multiple rows.
% \usepackage{multirow}

% Tables with captions and notes.
% \usepackage{threeparttable}

% Better Footnotes.
% \usepackage{footnote}

% Makes tables handle footnotes correctly.
% \makesavenoteenv{tabular}

% You can choose between:

% (a) One bibliography at the end of the document. This is appropriate
% for numbered citations (default).
\bibliographystyle{plainnat}	

% You can choose the title of the bibliography here:
% \renewcommand{\bibname}{My Own Title for References}


% (b) One bibliography at the end of the document plus a bibliography
% for each chapter. This only makes sense for "naming" bibliography
% styles, not for "numbering" styles: A style with numbering will give
% separate and unrelated numbers in each bibliography.

% This chooses an unnumbered bibliography style. 
% \bibliographystyle{unsrt} 

% You can choose the title of the global bibliography here:
% \renewcommand{\bibname}{Complete References}

% Include/uncomment the following lines at the end of each chapter .tex file:
% \bibliographystyle{plainnat}				
% \markright{\textit{Bibliography}}
% \renewcommand{\chaptername}{}
% \bibliography{my_references}

% To generate all bibliographies, proceed as follows:
% (1) Activate package chapterbib with option rootbib.
% \usepackage[rootbib]{chapterbib}
% (2) Run LaTeX.
% (3) Run BibTeX on the root file.
% (4) Deactivate option rootbib (i.e. load package without that option).
% \usepackage{chapterbib}
% (5) Run LaTeX.
% (6) Run BibTeX on each included file.
% (7) Run LaTeX twice.
